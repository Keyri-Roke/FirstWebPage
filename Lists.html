    </h4>Here is what I like about lists:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li> They're useful for displaying lists of stuff</li>
        <li> That's about it</li>
        <li> I'm gunna put another list item here because doing things in threes is cool</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>When you make a list, do it in this order </h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Decide if it's an ordered list or not</li>
        <li>If it's not an ordered list, use the ul tag, otherwise use the ol tag
            <ol>
                <ul style="list-style-type:open circle;">
                <li>Use li tags nested in the list for your lists items
                </>ul>
                    <ol>
                    <li>Curveball! You can nest lists inside each other</li>
                    </ol>
            </ol>
        <li> You've got this, I believe in you!
            
    </ol>
